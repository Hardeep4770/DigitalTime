  "body": "Welcome to Digital Clock\r\nI have created a code to show Digital Clock into your website. I have created this code using HTML and Jquery.\r\nYou can use this code show Digital Clock into any website you want.\r\n\r\n## HTML & Jquery \r\nTo use my code of Digital Clock you must have a basic knowledge of HTML & jQuery. As i mentioned earlier that this code is created using HTML & jQuery.\r\nYou will need the jQuery library to run this code. You can download the latest jQuery from [Here](https://jquery.com/download/)\r\nI am using jQuery 1.10.2\r\n\r\nOnce you get the jQuery, you will need to copy the jQuery file to somewhere into your project.\r\nThe code to add the jQuery to your HTML page is:\r\n\r\n`<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"jquery-1.10.2.js\"></script>`\r\n\r\nNote: you can change your path of \"src\" to something like \"js/jquery-1.10.2.js\".\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, we are ready to go with HTML code now\r\nFirst you have to copy the below code and paste it somewhere into your HTML page where ever you want to show the Digital Clock.\r\n\r\n### Code Goes like this \r\nHTML Code:\r\n`<body onload=\"startTime()\">\r\n    <div>\r\n       <div id=\"time\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</body>`\r\n\r\njQuery Code:\r\n\r\n    `<script>\r\n        function startTime() {\r\n            var today = new Date();\r\n            var h = today.getHours();\r\n            var m = today.getMinutes();\r\n            var s = today.getSeconds();\r\n            // add a zero in front of numbers<10\r\n            m = checkTime(m);\r\n            s = checkTime(s);\r\n            document.getElementById('time').innerHTML = h + \":\" + m + \":\" + s;\r\n            t = setTimeout(function () { startTime() }, 500);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        function checkTime(i) {\r\n            if (i < 10) {\r\n                i = \"0\" + i;\r\n            }\r\n            return i;\r\n        }\r\n    </script>` \r\n\r\n### How it works\r\nIn the \"BODY\" tag i have called a function \"startTime()\" on onload. It means when body loads it will call the function to start working and show time.\r\nThere should some element like \"Div\" to have a unique ID. This \"Div\" will be fetched by the jQuery function \"startTime()\" to show the current time into that \"Div\".\r\n\r\njQuery funtion \"startTime()\" will calculate the time using \"Date()\" function of jQuery. Then it will save the hour, minutes and seconds in some variables. Now, the \"Div\" with \"ID\" as \"time\" is fetched and all the variables are displayed into it.\r\n\"checkTime()\" function is created to add zero in from of single digits.\r\n\r\n### Author and Contributor\r\nGitHub Profile: Hardeep Singh [@Hardeep4770](https://github.com/Hardeep4770)\r\nVisit my Websites : [ExamJobResult](http://examjobresult.com), [ExamMinds](http://examminds.com)\r\n\r\n",
